solve real world problems.

01/2019 - 02/2019 HuePut Exclusive Contributer

Https://s3.amazonaws.com/core-color/index.html

« Add new colors to a community board

« Vote on colors by liking them

* Frontend is written in react hosted as static content in AWS s3
* Backend is an AWS lambda function + s3 as a DB

| really enjoyed making this project, | created it in such a way that the server that hosts the content does not exist until
a user interacts with it. As soon as a user visits the site, a server is created, content is served, then the server is
deleted. Every time an action is performed on the site it goes through this process, saving costs on AWS resources
and allowing it to be infinitely scalable.

This is an interview question that | created and made a solution to. Then in an effort to learn the Lambda and
serverless technology, | deployed my solution as an aws Lambda with an api gate trigger.

This is a golang package that runs math operations in multiple go routines, using parallel processes to run the same

correct answer. This allows us to continue math operations even if one of our processes were corrupted by the
physical environment.
